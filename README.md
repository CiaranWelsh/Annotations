# COMBINE Annotations

Example files using annotations in files produced by members of the COMBINE community. 

The goal is to come up with a standardized format for annotations which can be used across all of the model and data specification files.

There are 2 sets of example files:

##  Nonstandardized

Files [here](nonstandardized) contain annotations **as currently used** by various model and data description languages

##  Standardized

Files [here](standardized) contain annotations **according to the proposed unified COMBINE annotation format** for various model and data description languages.
