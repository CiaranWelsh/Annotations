Existing example(s) of CellML usage of annotations.

Notes:

- usual CellML suffix cellml has been changed to xml to allow as many editors as possible (including GitHub's online viewer) to display/color/validate the contents.
- RDF block at end of file ([source](https://models.cellml.org/exposure/9d046663ba5cac5c8a61ac146183614b)) was all on a single line, but has been formatted for easier reading.
