# COMBINE Annotations

Our goal is to develop a standardized format for annotations which can be used across all COMBINE model and data standards.

Two directories provide example annotation files:

##  Nonstandardized

Files [here](nonstandardized) contain example annotations **as currently used** by various model and data description formats.

##  Standardized

Files [here](standardized) will contain example annotations that adhere to **a unified COMBINE annotation format**, once it has been fully specified, for various model and data description formats.
